On [disable] MIDI notes, disable the replacement again. If a note is included in both [enable] and [disable], it will toggle the replacement. [port] specifies the port on which to run a TCP server to provide an unsecured API to enable the replacement. It can be switched off by setting [server] to false. Its interface can be set via [address] (default: localhost). netcat or other programs can be used to bind replacements to hotkeys via this API. Available API commands: enable|disable|toggle|unique [id]|next|previous. See the replace.py code comments for further details."
